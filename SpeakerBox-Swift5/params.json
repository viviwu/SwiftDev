It demonstrates several key areas:\r\n\r\nCreating a CXProvider and setting its delegate, in order to perform call actions in response to delegate callbacks. For example, the app's ProviderDelegate implements -provider:performAnswerCallAction: to handle answering an incoming call.\r\nCalling CXProvider API to provide updates to call metadata (using the CXCallUpdate class) and call lifecycle (using the various reportâ€¦ methods). For example, the app calls CXProvider.reportOutgoingCall(with:connectedAtDate:) to notify the system when an outgoing call has connected.\r\nCreating a CXCallController in order to request transactions in response to user interactions in the app. For example, to start an outgoing call, the app calls CXCallController.request(_:) to request a CXTransaction containing a CXStartCallAction.\r\nRegistering an app's CXProviderConfiguration, in order to configure certain behaviors of the app. For example, the app sets maximumCallsPerCallGroup to 1 to indicate that calls may not be grouped together.\r\nHandling call audio, including the correct points to configure the app's AVAudioSession versus starting call audio media. See configureAudioSession(), startAudio(), and stopAudio().\r\nStarting an outgoing call in response to an INStartAudioCallIntent, including introspecting the INInteraction and NSUserActivity which contain the intent.\r\nCopyright (C) 2016 Apple Inc.
