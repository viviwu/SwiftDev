# ‚ö†Ô∏è NO LONGER UNDER MAINTENANCE

Sorry guys, I'm going to close this repo soon.

Here're 3 reasons so I made the decision:

- The core concept of TodayMind is already opened source, it's good enough as a `widget` demo
- The `Social SDK` is gone, share extension is no longer a way to make a fancy widget
- The most important is, bad thing happened:

Fight with a thief is kinda waste my life.

There's no `whole` open source projects from my side in the future, although I do want to share nice things with community.

Maybe I will open source some `parts` of my app in the future, like the [LunarCore](https://github.com/cyanzhong/LunarCore) does.

Sorry for the decision, bye ‚ù§Ô∏è.
